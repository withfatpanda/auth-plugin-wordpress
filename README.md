* Designate which roles are given to Users when they register
* Protect your site from spam and abuse with [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)
* Two-factor authentication via SMS

This plugin is free to use in any project (public, private, non-profit and for-profit; dual licensed GPLv2 and MIT).

## About This Project

This plugin is the first to be built with the [illuminate-wordpress](https://github.com/withfatpanda/illuminate-wordpress) project.

illuminate-wordpress, powered by the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com), provides developers with an expressive, beautiful syntax for building faster for WordPress. Extending WordPress' REST API, defining custom data types and taxonomies, querying the database, and much more all made easier through a semantic, object-oriented API. 

The objective of illuminate-wordpress is to allow the entire community of Laravel developers to fall in love with WordPress the way that we have fallen in love with Laravel.
